###Aim
Please try to refactor the `sendGeneratedNotification()` function in the `Notification` class, so that it is as easy to understand, DRY and consistent as possible. As this is a refactoring task, the code does not need to be executed and knowledge of the dependencies is not required. Please comment your code as you see fit and commit your changes to git as if it were a real project, so that we can understand your workings.

##Submission
Please clone this repository, make your changes, then push the repository to your own Github profile and reply to us with the URL.
